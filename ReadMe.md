# Bus Mall

## Purpose

- The purpose of this excercise is to generate a constructor that can build objects for a focus group to vote on products that they would be likely to purchase.

## Objectives

- As a user, I would like to display three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.

- Create a constructor function that creates an object associated with each product, and has the following properties:
  - Name of the product
  - File path of image
  - Times the image has been shown
  - Create an algorithm that will randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.

  - For each of the three images, increment its property of times it has been shown by one.

  - Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.

  - Once the users ‘clicks’ a product, generate three new products for the user to pick from.
